GraphicsMode.py -- base class for "graphics modes" (display and GLPane event handling)

History:

bruce 071009 split modes.py into Command.py and GraphicsMode.py,
leaving only temporary compatibility mixins in modes.py.
For prior history see modes.py docstring before the split.

TODO:

A lot of methods in class GraphicsMode are private helper methods,
available to subclasses and/or to default implems of public methods,
but are not yet named as private or otherwise distinguished
from API methods. We should turn anyGraphicsMode into GraphicsMode_API
[done as of 071028],
add all the API methods to it, and rename the other methods
in class GraphicsMode to look private.

        # menu.exec_ returns, or just after (outside of all event processing).
        # I would guess "just before", in which case we have to worry about order
        # of side effects for any code we run after calling exec_, since in
        # general, our Qt event processing functions assume they are called purely
        # sequentially. I also don't know for sure whether the rightUp() method
        # would be called by Qt during or after the exec_ call. If any of this

        # yet know. (Or at least I don't yet know.)

               on the specific graphicsMode, it would also track a variable
               corresponding to the current graphicsMode (so that changes
               to the graphicsMode would invalidate whatever was derived
               from the return value). Until that's implemented, callers
               must use other methods to invalidate the values they derived
               from this when our actual return value changes, if that might
               have been due to a change in current graphicsMode.

         they end up doing, rather than using env.prefs directly.]
