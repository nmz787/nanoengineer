chunk.py -- provides class Chunk [formerly known as class molecule],

and selected as a unit.

History:

originally by Josh

lots of changes, by various developers

split out of chem.py by bruce circa 041118

bruce 050513 optimized some things, including using 'is' and 'is not' rather than
'==', '!=' for atoms, molecules, elements, parts, assys in many places (not
all commented individually)

bruce 060308 rewriting Atom and Chunk so that atom positions are always stored
in the atom (eliminating Atom.xyz and Chunk.curpos, adding Atom._posn,
eliminating incremental update of atpos/basepos). Motivation is to make it
simpler to rewrite high-frequency methods in Pyrex.

bruce 060313 splitting _recompute_atlist out of _recompute_atpos, and planning
to remove atom.index from undoable state. Rules for atom.index (old, reviewed
now and reconfirmed): owned by atom.molecule; value doesn't matter unless
atom.molecule and its .atlist exist (but is set to -1 otherwise when this is
convenient, to help catch bugs); must be correct whenever atom.molecule.atlist
exists (and is reset when it's made); correct means it's an index for that
atom into .atlist, .atpos, .basepos, whichever of those exist at the time
(atlist always does). This means a chunk's addatom, delatom, and _undo_update
need to invalidate its .atlist, and means there's no need to store atom.index
as undoable state (making diffs more compact), or to update a chunk's .atpos
(or even .atlist) when making an undo checkpoint.

(It would be nice for Undo to not store copies of changed .atoms dicts of
chunks too, but that's harder. ###e)

[update, bruce 060411: I did remove atom.index from undoable state, as well as
chunk.atoms, and I made atoms always store their own absposns. I forgot to
summarize the new rules here -- maybe I did somewhere else. Looking at the
code now, atoms still try to get baseposns from their chunk, which still
computes that before drawing them; moving a chunk probably invalidates atpos
and basepos (guess, but _recompute_atpos inval decl code would seem wrong
otherwise) and drawing it then recomputes them -- or maybe not, since it's
only when remaking display list that it should need to. Sometime I should
review this and see if there is some obvious optimization needed.]

bruce 080305 changed superclass from Node to NodeWithAtomContents

bruce 090115 split Chunk_Dna_methods from here into a new mixin class

bruce 090100 split Chunk_mmp_methods from here into a new mixin class

bruce 090100 split Chunk_drawing_methods from here into a new mixin class
(which on 090212 was turned into a cooperating separate class, ChunkDrawer)

bruce 090211 making compatible with TransformNode, though that is unfinished
and not yet actually used; places to fix for this are marked ####.

(Update: as of 090225 TransformNode is abandoned.
However, I'm leaving some comments that refer to TransformNode in place
(in still-active files), since they also help point out the code which any 
other attempt to optimize rigid drags would need to modify. In those comments,
dt and st refer to dynamic transform and static transform, as used in
scratch/TransformNode.py.)

# == Molecule (i.e. Chunk)

# Historical note:
#
# (Josh wrote:)
# I use "molecule" and "part" interchangeably throughout the program.
# this is the class intended to represent rigid collections of
# atoms bonded together, but it's quite possible to make a molecule
# object with unbonded atoms, and with bonds to atoms in other
# molecules
#
# [bruce 050315 adds: I've seen "part" used for the assembly, but not for "chunk"
#  (which is the current term for instances of class molecule aka Chunk).
#  Now, however, each assy has one or more Parts, each with its own
#  physical space, containing perhaps many bonded chunks. So any use of
#  "part" to mean "chunk" would be misleading.]

# Note: we immediately kill any Chunk which loses all its atoms after having
# had some. If this ever causes problems (unlikely -- it's been done since
# 041116), we should instead do it when we update the model tree or glpane,
# since we need to ensure it's always done by the end of any user event.
