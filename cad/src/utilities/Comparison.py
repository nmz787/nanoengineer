    (Note: there is a C version of this method which is normally used by NE1.
     It has the same name as this method and overwrites this one
     due to an assignment near the end of this method's source file.
     This method is the reference version, coded in Python.
     This version is used by some developers who don't build the C version
     for some reason.)
    
    Efficiently scan v1 and v2 in parallel to determine whether they're the
    same, for purposes of undoable state or saved state.

    Note: the only reason we really need this method (as opposed to just
    using Python '==' or '!=' and our own __eq__ methods)
    is because Numeric.array.__eq__ is erroneously defined, and if we were
    using '==' or '!=' on a Python tuple containing  a Numeric array,
    we'd have no way of preventing this issue from making '==' or '!='
    come out wrong on the tuple.

    (For details, see bruce email to 'all' of 060302, partially included below.)

    It turns out that you can safely naively use != on Numeric arrays,
    but not ==, since they both act elementwise, and this only 
    does what you usually want with != . I knew this in the past
    (and fixed some weird bugs caused by it) but forgot it recently,
    so Undo was thinking that atom position arrays had not changed
    provided at least one coordinate of one atom had not changed.

    [But note that you can't use either '==' or '!=' on tuples that might
    contain Numeric arrays, since either way, Python uses '==' on the
    tuple elements.]

    In particular:

    a = Numeric.array((1, 2, 3))
    b = Numeric.array((1, 2, 3))
    assert a == b                  # result: [1 1 1], interpreted as True
    assert not a != b              # result: [0 0 0], interpreted as False
    b = Numeric.array((1, 4, 5))
    assert a != b                  # result: [1 0 0], interpreted as True
    assert not a == b              # result: [0 1 1], interpreted as True
    # the last assertion fails!

    Do the maintainers of Numeric consider this to be correct
    behavior?!?!?!?  Probably.

    What they should have done was define a new ufunc for equality
    testing, and made the semantics of __eq__ and __ne__ work as
    expected.  Probably too late to expect them to change this now.

    As long as we have it, we might as well make it a bit more stringent
    than Python '==' in other ways too, like not imitating the behaviors
    (which are good for '==') of 1.0 == 1, array([1]) == [1], etc.
    The only reason we'll count non-identical objects as equal is that
    we're not interested in their addresses or in whether someone
    will change one of them and not the other (for whole objects or for
    their parts).

# implem/design discussion
# [very old; slightly clarified, bruce 090205; see new summary below]:
#
# Choice 1:
# no need for _same_InstanceType_helper; we set up all (old-style) classes
# so that their __eq__ method is good enough; this only works if we assume
# that any container-like instances (which compare their parts) are ones we
# wrote, so they don't use == on Numeric arrays, and don't use == or != on
# general values.
#
# Choice 2:
# on naive objects, we just require id(v1) == id(v2).
# Downside: legitimate data-like classes by others, with proper __eq__
# methods, will compare different when they should be same.
# Upside: if those classes have Numeric parts and compare them with ==,
# that's a bug, which we'll avoid.
# Note that if it's only our own classes which run, and if they have no bugs,
# then it makes no difference which choice we use.
#
### UNDECIDED. For now, doing nothing is equivalent to Choice 1.
# but note that choice 2 is probably safer.
# in fact, if I do that, i'd no longer need _eq_id_mixin just due to StateMixin.
# (only when __getattr__ and someone calls '==') [060303]
# 
# Update 060306: some objects will need _s_same_as(self, other) different from
# __eq__, since __eq__ *might* want to compare some components with !=
# (like int and float) rather than be as strict as same_vals.
# Even __eq__ needs to try to avoid the "Numeric array in list" bug,
# which in some cases will force it to also call same_vals,
# but when types are known it's plausible that it won't have to,
# so the distinct methods might be needed.
# When we first need _s_same_as, that will force use of a new
# _same_InstanceType_helper func. Do we need it before then? Not sure.
# Maybe not; need to define __eq__ better in GAMESS Jig (bug 1616) but
# _s_same_as can probably be the same method. OTOH should we let DataMixin
# be the thing that makes _s_same_as default to __eq__?? ###
######@@@@@@
#
# update, bruce 060419, after thinking about bug 1869
# (complaint about different bonds with same key):
# - The Bond object needs to use id for sameness, in Undo diffs at least
#  (only caller of same_vals?) (but can't use id for __eq__ yet).
#   - Q: What is it about Bond that decides that -- Bond? StateMixin? not DataMixin?
#     A: The fact that scan_children treats it as a "child object",
#     not as a data object (see obj_is_data method).
#     That's what makes Undo change attrs in it, which only makes sense if
#     Undo treats refs to it (in values of other attrs, which it's diffing)
#     as the same iff their id is same.
# Conclusion: we need to use the same criterion in same_vals, via a new
# _same_InstanceType_helper -- *not* (only) a new method
# [later: I guess I meant the '_s_same_as' method -- nim, discussed only here]
# as suggested above and in a comment I added to bug 1869 report.
# For now, we don't need the new method at all.
#
# ==
#
# Update, bruce 090205: reviewing the above, there are only the following cases
# where same_vals needs to disagree with '==', given that we are free to define
# proper __eq__/__ne__ methods in our own code:
#
# * Numeric arrays (due to the design flaw in their __eq__ method semantics)
#
# * Python data objects which might contain Numeric arrays
#   (i.e. list, dict, tuple -- also 'set', if we start using that in model
#    state -- we don't do so yet, since it's not supported in our minimum
#    supported Python version)
#
# * supporting same_vals(1, 1.0) == False, for conservatism in Undo
#   (but note that most __eq__ methods don't bother to worry about that
#    when comparing components in data-like instances; often this is justified,
#    either since they treat those values equivalently or only store them with
#    one type, so it's reasonable to permit it even though it could in theory
#    lead to bugs)
#
# * any future similar cases of same_vals being more conservative than __eq__,
#   especially if they apply within instances, motivating us to define a new
#   "data API" method called '_s_same_as' (not needed for now); OTOH, any new
#   cases of that should be deprecated, as far as I know
#
# * for Bond, as long as it has an __eq__ method more liberal than id comparison
#   (used by same_vals), since as a State holder, id comparison is correct in
#   principle. It only needs the looser __eq__ due to old code in a bad style,
#   but it's hard to know whether that code is entirely gone (and I think it's
#   not and is hard to finally remove it).
#
# How does this affect the issue of changing Node to a new-style class?
# If we do this with no code changes, Nodes lose the services of
# _same_InstanceType_helper, but the above suggests they might never have
# needed it anyway -- of the above issues, only the ones concerned with
# '_s_same_as' and 'Bond' apply to instances of old or new classes.
#
# Conclusion: we can ignore extending _same_InstanceType_helper to new-style
# Nodes -- in fact, we could dispense with it entirely in current code except
# for Bond. (See also the 090205 comments in the docstring of state_utils.py.)
#
# (FYI: If we were to write a completely new framework, I think we'd use our
# own classes rather than Numeric, with proper semantics for ==/!=,
# and then dispense with same_vals entirely, relying on '==' even for Undo.)
