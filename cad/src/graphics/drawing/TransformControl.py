TransformControl.py -- A local coordinate frame for a set of CSDLs.

WARNING: This class is deprecated, though it's still used by some test cases
and still partly supported in the code. It was never finished. As of 090223,
the CSDL attribute intended for instances of this class is filled by Chunks.

History:
Originally written by Russ Fish; designed together with Bruce Smith.

================================================================

See design comments on:
* GL contexts, CSDLs and DrawingSet in DrawingSet.py
* TransformControl in TransformControl.py
* VBOs, IBOs, and GLPrimitiveBuffer in GLPrimitiveBuffer.py
* GLPrimitiveSet in GLPrimitiveSet in GLPrimitiveSet.py

== TransformControl ==

* CSDLs are now created with a TransformControl reference as an argument
  (and are internally listed in it while they exist).

  - This TransformControl reference is constant (although the transform in the
     TransformControl is mutable.)

  - For convenience, the TransformControl argument can be left out if you don't
    want to use a TransformControl to move the CSDL. This has the same effect as
    giving a TransformControl whose transform remains as the identity matrix.

* A TransformControl controls where a set of CSDLs appear, with a common
  coordinate transform giving the local coordinate system for the objects in the
  CSDLs.

* A TransformControl gains and loses CSDLs, as they are created in it, or
  destroyed.

* The API need not provide external access to, or direct modification of, the
  set of CSDLs in a TransformControl.

* The transform is mutable, represented by a quaternion and a translation vector
  (or the equivalent).  (Later, we may have occasion to add a scale as well.)

* Interactions like dragging can be efficiently done by drawing the drag
  selection as a separate DrawingSet, viewed through an incremental modeling
  transform controlled by mouse drag motion.  Afterward, the drag transform will
  be combined with the transform in the TransformControls for the selected CSDLs
  (using changeAllTransforms, below).

* Since there is no matrix stack to change in the middle of a batched draw,
  TransformControl transforms are stored in the graphics card RAM for use by
  vertex shaders, either in texture memory or constant memory, indexed by a
  transform_id.  Transform_ids are stored in per-vertex attribute VBOs.

** If this proves too slow or unworkable on some drivers which could otherwise
   be supported, there is a fallback option of modifying VBO vertex coordinates
   after transforms change (lazily, as needed for drawing).

* The parameters for primitives are stored in per-vertex attribute VBOs as well,
  in local coordinates relative to the TransformControl transform.

* DrawingSet.changeAllTransforms(transform) combines a given transform with
  those stored in the TransformControls of all CSDLs in this DrawingSet. (Note
  that this affects all CSDLs in those TransformControls, even if they are not
  in this DrawingSet.)
